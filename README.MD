#### Installing dependencies && Running / Testing locally

Install [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) just so we're on the same page. <br>
Did you clone the repo? No? Why not? ...I hope it's cloned by now. If not, you're in [big trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuRC3HEJ71M&ab_channel=JoelF1). <br/>

Now you are faced with a choice. Do you want to run your tests with or without forking mumbai testnet?

###### Fork Mumbai:

SlyDe.Fi is supportive of forking. Some of our best friends are forkers. <br>

bash ./run*tests.sh
press \_m* to fork mumbai testnet and run tests

###### Locally

bash ./run*tests.sh
press \_l* to run local test suite

###### I trust every other line of code in this repo with the exception of your bashable script

npm install && truffle test

###### Walkthrough

##### Windows

No clue how any of this works on Windows.
#TODO: Call Windows support and ask.
