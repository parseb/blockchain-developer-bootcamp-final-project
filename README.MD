<p>describes the project: Jesus. Has nothing to do with this. But, you can bet your cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>SlyDe.fi is an entartaining prediction overconfidence exploiting re-distributive mechanism that uses pool-todghether-like yield farming.</p>

#### Installing dependencies AND Running/Testing locally

Install [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) just so we're on the same page. <br>
Also, a good idea would be to have truffle installed (and npm): <br>

> npm install -g truffle

Did you clone the repo? No? Why not? ...I hope it's cloned by now. If not, you're in [big trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuRC3HEJ71M&ab_channel=JoelF1). <br/>

Now you are faced with a choice. Do you want to run your tests with or without forking mumbai testnet?

##### Fork Mumbai:

> bash ./run_tests.sh

press m to fork mumbai testnet and run tests

##### Locally

> bash ./run_tests.sh

press l to run local test suite

##### I trust every other line of code in this repo with the exception of your bashable script

> npm install && truffle test

##### I want to run the frontend locally

You will need a Moralis server. At the top of main.js you have to define: <br>

> const SERVER_URL /// Moralis Server URL <br>
> const APPID ///Moralis App ID

After that, just open Index.html in a browser.
